              What Makes This Practice Special
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Amend Therapy is intentionally designed as a boutique practice, which means I work with a 
              limited number of clients to ensure each person receives the personalized attention and 
              care they deserve.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              When you work with me, you're not just another appointment on a scheduleâ€”you're a unique 
              individual with your own story, challenges, and goals. I take the time to truly understand 
              your situation and tailor our work together to meet your specific needs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              My approach is warm, authentic, and down-to-earth. I believe in being real with my clients 
              while maintaining the professional boundaries that keep our work effective and safe.
